### Key Components

#### CPUScheduler Class
The main class handling all scheduling algorithms and UI interactions:

```javascript
class CPUScheduler {
    constructor() {
        this.processes = [];
        this.ganttData = [];
        this.metrics = [];
        this.processColors = [...];
        // ... initialization
    }
    
    // Algorithm implementations
    calculateFCFS() { /* ... */ }
    calculateSJF() { /* ... */ }
    calculateSRTF() { /* ... */ }
    // ... other algorithms
}
```

#### Algorithm Implementations
- **Theoretical Accuracy**: All algorithms follow standard CPU scheduling theory
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient implementations for large-scale testing
